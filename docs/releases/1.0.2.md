# Workflow 1.0.2

*January 12, 2023*


Workflow 1.0.2 fixes a regression bug blocking the library usage on
Python 3.11.


## Bugfixes

- Fixes [#316](https://github.com/fgmacedo/python-statemachine/issues/316) a bad
  import of 'inspect.getargspec' that was removed on Python 3.11,
  still backwards compatible with older versions.
