# Workflow 2.1.2

*October  6, 2023*

This release improves the setup performance of the library by a 10x factor, with a major
refactoring on how we handle the callbacks registry and validations.

See [#401](https://github.com/fgmacedo/python-statemachine/issues/401) for the technical details.


## Python compatibility 2.1.2

Workflow 2.1.2 supports Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12.

On the next major release (3.0.0), we will drop support for Python 3.7.

## Bugfixes in 2.1.2

- Fixes [#406](https://github.com/fgmacedo/python-statemachine/issues/406) action callback being
  called twice when mixing decorator syntax combined with the naming convention.
